Welcome to jsx-slack v2! Let me introduce shiny new features in v2!

## Migration from v1

Don't be scared! **The basic usage of jsx-slack is exactly same as v1.** Almost user of jsx-slack don't need to change the code written in v1 and can bump jsx-slack to v2 straightly. :sunglasses:

Only `<CheckboxGroup>` and `<Checkbox>` have a breaking change may have the impact to initial options. See details in "**[Breaking change](#breaking-change)**" section if you have using them.

## Highlights

The traditional usage of jsx-slack was wrapping JSX in `JSXSlack()` function.

Since v1.5.0, some components have not been required to wrap by made serializable to JSON directly. And v2 will take this concept a step further!

### JSX returns the real JSON

The core API for JSX has updated, _to return the real JSON object for Slack API from all built-in components._

It means always no need to wrap JSX in `JSXSlack()`! Just writing JSX would work.

```jsx
console.log(
  <Blocks>
    <Section>
      Welcome to <b>jsx-slack v2</b>!
    </Section>
  </Blocks>
)
```

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```javascript
[{
  type: 'section',
  text: {
    type: 'mrkdwn',
    text: 'Welcome to *jsx-slack v2*!',
    verbatim: true
  }
}]
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

`JSXSlack()` is still provided but there is no operataions. Just return the passed value.

#### Create partial JSON

Fully renewed built-in components will be useful to build a partial JSON too.

v1 components might return an invalid object with Slack API by including internal fields for jsx-slack, but v2 will always create the valid partial JSON.

```jsx
console.log(
  <Mrkdwn>
    Welcome to <b>jsx-slack v2</b>!
  </Mrkdwn>
)
```

```javascript
{ type: 'mrkdwn', text: 'Welcome to *jsx-slack v2*!' }
```

#### Tips for TypeScript

When you are using TypeScript, the returned type from JSX would not match to Slack Node SDK so **require to cast JSX into the suitable type**.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```typescript
(
  <Blocks>
    <Section>TypeScript needs to cast</Section>
  </Blocks>
) as any
```

<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

`JSXSlack()` has become just a type helper to cast JSX into `any` type. _We recommend for TS developer to wrap JSX in `JSXSlack()` as same as jsx-slack v1._

```typescript
// TS user should use the compatible syntax with jsx-slack v1
JSXSlack(
  <Blocks>
    <Section>TypeScript needs to cast</Section>
  </Blocks>
)
```

### React-compatible API

We've organized JSX features and added some public API compatible with React.

- `JSXSlack.createElement()` (means as same as `JSXSlack.h()`)
- `JSXSlack.isValidElement()`
- `JSXSlack.Children`
  - `JSXSlack.Children.map()`
  - `JSXSlack.Children.forEach()`
  - `JSXSlack.Children.count()`
  - `JSXSlack.Children.only()`
  - `JSXSlack.Children.toArray()`

### Improved JSDoc

Slack Block Kit has continuously evolved. jsx-slack is working harder to catch up on the latest release of Slack API.

On the other hand, the documentation of jsx-slack has bloated compared to the first version. jsx-slack aims to the alternative interface for building Slack Block Kit easily, but developer would not want dizzy eyes by switching between the code and jsx-slack documentation.

jsx-slack v2 has included JSDoc to many public APIs. While using jsx-slack through JSX transpiler, developer can peek a useful instant help without leaving IDE.

### `<Option selected>` and `<RadioButton checked>`

jsx-slack makes a better experience for building Block Kit JSON, with the familiar HTML style. v2 added support for (HTML-compatible) `<Option selected>` and `<RadioButton checked>`.

```jsx
<Blocks>
  <section>
    <p>Select options:</p>
    <select multiple name="options">
      <option selected>Option A</option>
      <option selected>Option B</option>
      <option>Option C</option>
    </select>
  </section>
</Blocks>
```

Contents of `<Blocks>` will work both in HTML and jsx-slack. It makes a better developer experience in setting the initial state of the static select and the radio button group.

`<Select value="...">` and `<RadioButtonGroup value="...">`, the classic way to set initial selected / checked option(s), will still work. Please notice that _`selected` and `checked` will be ignored_ when setting `value` prop in the parent component.

```jsx
<Blocks>
  <section>
    <b>NOTE: Prefer the parent `value` prop to `selected` state.</b>
    <select multiple name="options" value="c">
      <option value="a" selected>
        Option A
      </option>
      <option value="b" selected>
        Option B
      </option>
      <option value="c">Option C (Actually selected)</option>
    </select>
  </section>
</Blocks>
```

> :warning: To make consistency in the whole of jsx-slack, v2 has a breaking change for the behavior of `<CheckboxGroup values={[...]}>` and `<Checkbox checked>` (They already have provided since v1). See details in "[Breaking change](#breaking-change)".

### More helpful error message

jsx-slack will throw an error when there is invalid JSX structure, but the error message in v1 is not so helpful to know where is the cause.

```jsx
// v1 throws "<Actions> block has an incompatible element as children.", but which element is?
<Blocks>
  <Actions>
    <ConversationsSelect name="conversations" multiple />
    <Button name="send" style="primary">
      Send
    </Button>
    <Button name="cancel" style="danger">
      Cancel
    </Button>
  </Actions>
</Blocks>
```

v2 has improved a lot of error messages, to display the specific reason of error and a name of built-in component which was triggered an error as possible.

In the above case, v2 throws the error with more useful message: `<Actions> cannot include the element for selection from multiple options: <ConversationsSelect multiple>`

**BONUS**: If you are using [`@babel/preset-react`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react) with `development` mode, the stack trace of the error will point out the exact JSX location instead of jsx-slack's internal. It becomes easy to move quickly into the errored JSX.

### The other notable updates

- `<Home>` container now accepts `<Input type="hidden" />` and custom transformer to store private metadata.
- `value` prop for `<Option>` has made optional. jsx-slack will generate `value` text from the content for display if `value` was not defined.
- Some interactive components have added `value` prop, as work as an alias into existing `initialXXX` prop. No need to worry different interfaces for setting initial value by components.
- `confirm` prop for interactive block elements accepts the raw confirm composition object.
- `<a>` tag now renders short syntax for hyperlink if possible.

### Experimental features

#### Support `automatic` runtime of [Babel JSX transpiler](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react)

Babel has expected [many breaking changes for JSX transpiler](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/10746) in next major version 8. Prior to them, [Babel 7.9.0 has shipped with a new JSX transformation](https://babeljs.io/blog/2020/03/16/7.9.0) that was based on [React RFC](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/blob/createlement-rfc/text/0000-create-element-changes.md), called as `automatic` runtime. It would be a default runtime of JSX in Babel 8.

jsx-slack v2 has an experimental implementation to support new JSX transformation `automatic` runtime.

```javascript
// babel.config.js
module.exports = (api) => ({
  presets: [
    [
      '@babel/preset-react',
      {
        runtime: 'automatic',
        importSource: '@speee-js/jsx-slack',
        development: api.env('development'),
      },
    ],
  ],
})
```

The advantage is no longer need to require importing implicitly used `JSXSlack` manually.

```jsx
const { Blocks, Section } = require('@speee-js/js-slack')

console.log(
  <Blocks>
    <Section>
      <p>Hello, world!</p>
    </Section>
  </Blocks>
)
```

Developers only have to import required built-in components so JSX code will look like more intuitive. See details in [#142](https://github.com/speee/jsx-slack/pull/142).

## Breaking change

### `<CheckboxGroup values={[...]}>` and `<Checkbox checked>`

v1 had merged initially checked options defined by _both of `<Checkbox checked>` and `<CheckboxGroup values>`_.

```jsx
// In jsx-slack v1, B and C will set as initial options.
<Home>
  <Actions>
    <CheckboxGroup values={['b']}>
      <Checkbox value="a">A</Checkbox>
      <Checkbox value="b">B</Checkbox>
      <Checkbox value="c" checked>
        C
      </Checkbox>
    </CheckboxGroup>
  </Actions>
</Home>
```

However, this behavior may not set correct initial states when setting initial values from Slack callback through `values` prop of `<CheckboxGroup>`.

jsx-slack v2 will **always adopt either of them, and prefer `<CheckboxGroup values>` to `<Checkbox checked>`**. The state defined in `checked` prop of `<Checkbox>` would be adopted only when not defined `values` prop in the parent `<CheckboxGroup>`.

In the above case, _will be ignored the `checked` state of C, and initially checked options become only B._

### Changes for TypeScript

- Now requires **TypeScript >= 3.7**, due to using [recursive type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/release-notes/typescript-3-7.html#more-recursive-type-aliases) in JSX.

* All of container components and some interactive components have more strict children type checking. If you saw new compile errors, please ensure that children have only valid components.
  - Especially if you are using [React-like conditional rendering `{value && <Section>...</Section>}`](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html#inline-if-with-logical--operator), the left side of `&&` operator must be boolean (e.g. `{!!value && <Section>...</Section>}`).

- Exported type `JSXSlack.Child` and `JSXSlack.Children` in v1 have been renamed into `JSXSlack.ChildElement` and `JSXSlack.ChildElements` to avoid conflict with added React-compatible API, and meaningless generics defined in them were removed.

## Deprecated

- `jsxslack.raw` has already deprecated because the new JSX structure let it become no need to use. Just rename `jsxslack.raw` into `jsxslack` to fix.
